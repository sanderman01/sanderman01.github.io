# Alexander Verbeek, Game Developer

Creative and software engineer with a strong passion for video games. 8 Years experience in the field of video game design and development.  

My proudest accomplishment: Developing and releasing the platformer game iO to Steam and mobile stores from scratch, with a tiny team, from start to finish.  
Other notable projects include: Porting SpeedRunners (DoubleDutch) to console platforms and Escapists2 (Codeglue/Team17) to mobile platforms.

Colleagues consider me a persistent, focused problem solver, able to perform under pressure of deadlines and hard problems. 
My careful and conscientious nature helps me solve large, complex problems. Though I struggle with ambiguously defined tasks or expectations.
A broad range of skills makes me good at jumping on anything that might come up in a project.

I like to experiment to learn new techniques, technologies or skills regularly, though finding time to do so can sometimes be difficult.

Hobbies include fantasy and sci-fi novels, anime, cycling to/from work, and pen & paper roleplaying games. Currently involved in a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.  
Favorite video games include Dwarf Fortress, Oxygen Not Included, Europa Universalis 4, Kerbal Space Program, Minecraft, Factorio, Dark Souls, Monster Hunter World, Satisfactory.
