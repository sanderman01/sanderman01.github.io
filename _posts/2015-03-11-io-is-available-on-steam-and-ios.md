Yes. I'm stil alive. I am guilty as charged for not updating this blog since forever.

With that out of the way, let's focus on some good news! <del>Size Matters</del> <del>Expandaball</del> iO is finally released, after two name changes and way too much time in development! I also wrote a <a title="iO" href="https://sanderman0.wordpress.com/portfolio/io/">page summarizing the whole development process.</a>

Get it now! On the following platforms:

<a title="Steam" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/324070/" target="_blank">Steam</a>

i<a title="iOS" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id960831187" target="_blank">OS</a>

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamious.ioenhanced" target="_blank">Google Play</a>

<a title="Ouya" href="https://www.ouya.tv/game/iO/" target="_blank">Ouya</a><del> (Oh, who am I kiddng. Nobody actually uses Ouya)</del>

Buy the game or try the demo!

Don't forget to leave a review! It helps out a lot!

I already have a new game project in the works.

I should really revive this blog and update more regularly. Maybe write something about the Level Design process for iO?
