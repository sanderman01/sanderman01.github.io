A lot has been going on these past few months for me. I am sad to say this blog has been neglected a bit, though that will change.

In Januari I participated in the Global Game Jam, in location Hilversum. Me and my team made a very nice and simple game which was received very well by the audience and which won third prize in the popularity contest and first prize by the jury. Me and my team are now looking at options to develop this further. Jamming is a great experience and I recommend it to every game developer.
